## Build
  The Rfduino board files (found here)[https://github.com/RFduino/RFduino] needs to be added to a Arduino 1.5.x ide.

  The Adafruit NeoPixel library requires modification to run on the rfduino. Put the `Adafruit_NeoPixel-modified` into your Arduino 1.5.x's library folder. See (this)[http://forum.rfduino.com/index.php?topic=30.45] forum thread, it's stupid nobody uses source control.
