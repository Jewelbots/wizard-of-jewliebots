## Features
 - [x] RFDuino loading
 - [ ] NeoPixel Driving
 - [ ] Peer to Peer bluetooth sensing
 - [ ] Host configurable

## Build
  The Rfduino board files (found here)[https://github.com/RFduino/RFduino] needs to be added to a Arduino 1.5.8 ide. 1.5.7 and 1.5.8 might too slow or something stupid, but the current rfduino requires it.

  The Adafruit NeoPixel library requires modification to run on the rfduino. Put the `Adafruit_NeoPixel-modified` into your Arduino 1.5.x's library folder. See (this)[http://forum.rfduino.com/index.php?topic=30.45] forum thread, it's stupid nobody uses source control. Except this guy kinda https://github.com/don/Adafruit_NeoPixel
